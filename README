This is pyrepl 0.7, a readline-a-like in Python.

http://starship.python.net/crew/mwh/hacks/pyrepl.html

It requires python 2.1 (or newer) with either the curses and termios
modules built or pygame, and features:

 * sane multi-line editing
 * history, with incremental search
 * completion, including displaying of available options
 * a fairly large subset of the readline emacs-mode keybindings
   (adding more is mostly just a matter of typing)
 * a liberal, Python-style, license
 * a new python top-level
 * no global variables, so you can run two or more independent readers
   without having their histories interfering.
 * no hogging of control -- it should be easy to integrate pyrepl into
   YOUR application's event loop.
 * generally speaking, a much more interactive experience than readline
   (it's a bit like a cross between readline and emacs's mini-buffer)

There are probably still a few little bugs & misfeatures, but _I_ like
it, and use it as my python top-level most of the time.

To get a feel for it, just execute:

$ python pythoni

(One point that may confuse: because the arrow keys are used to move
up and down in the command currently being edited, you need to use ^P
and ^N to move through the history)

If you like what you see, you can install it with the familiar

$ python setup.py install

which will also install the above "pythoni" script.

Please direct comments to mwh@python.net.

(If you've released open source software you'll know how frustrating
it is to see a couple of hundred downloads and only get a handful of
emails, so don't think I'll be irritated by the banality of your
comments!)

Summary of new stuff in 0.7.1:
 + A non-broken setup.py...

Summary of new stuff in 0.7.0:
 + Moved to a package architecture.
 + Wrote a (very simple!) distutils setup.py script.
 + Changed the keyspec format to be more sensible.  See the docstring
   in pyrepl/keymap.py for more information.
 + Portability fixes.
 + Various tortuous changes to use 2.2 features where possible but
   retaining 2.1 support (I hope; haven't got a 2.1 here to test with).
 + Jumping up and down on control-C now shouldn't dump you out of
   pyrepl (via a large hammer kind of approach).
 + Bug fixes, particularly in the history handling stuff.
 + reader.Reader has a new method, bind(), intended to be used by the
   user.
 + Changes to the init file handling.
 + Sundry code reorganization.  Libraries built on top of pyrepl will
   probably require small modifications (but I'm not sure anyone has
   written  any of these yet!).
 + A prototypical pygame console.
